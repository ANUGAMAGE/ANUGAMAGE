## Hi there I am Anu

My background is rooted in the medical field, where I initially built a strong foundation. Over time, I expanded my expertise to include Python programming, organic chemistry, and computer science. This multidisciplinary approach eventually led me to specialize in Cheminformatics, Quantum Chemistry and Computational Chemistry, with a focus on drug discovery and materials science research.

My journey in the universe of Cheminformatics and Computational Chemistry has been guided by [ Mr. Sul ](https://github.com/Sulstice), who has been an invaluable mentor and educator. Currently, I am leveraging my research experience to support scientists and business professionals in the U.S. through Global-Chemistry Inc. I help them build and grow their ventures, utilizing my expertise in research and development within this field.

Furthermore, by sharing my knowledge and expertise, I aim to contribute to the development of a skilled and empowered younger generation, providing opportunities for talented individuals and ultimately fostering a better future for our society.
