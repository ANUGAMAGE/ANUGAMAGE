## Hi there I am Anu

My background is rooted in the medical field, where I initially built a strong foundation. Over time, I expanded my expertise to include Python programming, organic chemistry, and computer science. This multidisciplinary approach eventually led me to specialize in Cheminformatics and Computational Chemistry, with a focus on drug discovery and materials science research.
